### Bike Sharing Demand

##### This project consists of Time-Series Analysis of Bike Sharing Demand over time. In this project, we will first understand the data and achieve stationarity by using various transformation methods. We then use Time-Series Decomposition methods to test if the data is completely detrended and seasonality has been adjusted. This is done by using the STL-Decomposition Method. We then begin by using simple forecasting methods on our original data, including the base models such as Holt-Winter Method, Average Method, Na√Øve Method, Drift and Simple Exponential Smoothing Method. We then use the OLS Regression Method, here we first check the collinearity among the features and then use Backward Stepwise regression for Feature Selection and to get our best model. We then develop an ARIMA model on the transformed data, we first determine the order of the AR and MA processes using ACF/PACF Plots and GPAC, and then estimate the parameters for the model. We evaluate all these models using the Mean- Squared Error of Forecast error, Variance of errors, Q-Value and Correlation Coefficients. We also plot the ACF Plots for each residual errors to see if the residuals fall under white noise.
