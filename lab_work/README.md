Time-Series Lab work

Lab 1: 
Stationarity:

	Rolling Mean and Rolling Average
    
    	ADFuller Test: H0: The series has a unit root (it is non-stationary) 
                H1: The series is no unit root (it is stationary) 

    	KPSS Test: H0: The series trends stationary 
                H1: The series is a unit root (it is non-stationary)
